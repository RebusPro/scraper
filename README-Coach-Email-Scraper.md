3. **Reduced Wait Times**: Optimized timeouts to avoid unnecessary waiting
4. **Minimal Content Processing**: Only processes visible content when possible

1. Select **Thorough Mode** for best results
2. Enter the URL of the coaching directory

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

Our enhanced scraper can now detect:

1. **Standard Email Formats**: Visible mailto: links and text emails
2. **Hidden Emails in JavaScript**: Emails embedded in code
3. **Encoded/Obfuscated Emails**: Emails protected from basic scrapers
4. **Special Format Variations**: Different patterns used to hide emails from bots

## Technical Details (For Reference)

The system employs several techniques to ensure thorough email extraction:

- **Multiple Browser Engines**: Uses both Chromium and Firefox engines for compatibility
