# Email Scraper Improvements Documentation

## Issues Addressed

Based on user feedback, we've identified and fixed several key issues with the email scraper:

1. **False Positives in Email Detection**

   - System was recognizing PNG filenames as emails (e.g., `40x40_claim_your_page_v2@2x.yji-bd2968af3654281a8794.png`)
   - UI text like "Reset password link" was being detected as email content
   - Placeholder text like `${email}` was being captured

2. **Missing Emails on Specific Pages**

   - Some sites like `championsskatingcenter.com/coaches` had emails that weren't being detected
   - Contact pages like `rays-rentals.com/contact-us/` had visible emails not being extracted

3. **Incomplete Contact Information**

   - Names were not being properly associated with emails
   - Titles/positions were found but not always linked correctly to the right person
   - Example: `jshaffer@therinks.com` was correctly matched with "Coordinator" title but missed the "Jacqie Shaffer" name

4. **Dynamic Content Handling Issues**
   - Pages with highly dynamic JavaScript content weren't being properly scraped
   - No special handling for coach directories which often have unique structures

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Pattern Detection

We've significantly improved the email extraction logic to:

- **Filter out false positives**

  - Added validation to skip placeholder text patterns like `${email}`

- **Expanded detection patterns**
  - Improved the name extraction with multiple pattern strategies
  - Added support for different name-email association formats

### 3. Better Name and Title Extraction

  - Added multiple name pattern strategies (dash format, colon format, etc.)
  - Extended context window for better name-email associations
  - Added support for names in brackets/parentheses

- **Title extraction enhancements**
  - Added more title patterns specific to coaching positions
  - Improved recognition of common title formats (e.g., "Name - Title")
