# Enhanced Web Scraper Solution

This enhanced web scraper has been designed to handle websites with dynamic content, API calls, form interactions, and various other modern web features. With these improvements, the scraper can effectively retrieve content from a wide range of websites.

## Key Features & Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Network Monitoring

The scraper now intelligently monitors all network traffic when using the headless browser mode:

- **Dynamic API Response Detection**: Automatically identifies potential API endpoints using intelligent pattern matching for URLs and content types.
- **JSON Processing Engine**: Recursively processes any JSON structure, regardless of nesting level or naming conventions.
- **Content-Type Analysis**: Detects different response types (JSON, HTML, JavaScript) and processes each accordingly.

### 2. Flexible Form Interaction

The scraper can now interact with forms and wait for dynamic content to load:

- **Multi-field Support**: Fill out search forms, login forms, or any interactive elements.
- **Intelligent Wait Logic**: Waits for elements to appear, or uses a configurable timeout.
- **Event Handling**: Properly simulates real user interactions (clicking, typing, selecting).

### 3. Universal Data Extraction

Enhanced extraction capabilities that work across any website structure:

- **Recursive JSON Extraction**: Extracts data from any JSON structure, regardless of depth or naming conventions.
- **Field Name Recognition**: Intelligently identifies common field patterns (email, name, phone, etc.).
- **Context Building**: Creates useful context information even from unstructured data.

### 4. Browser Fingerprint Evasion

Improved techniques to avoid detection as a bot:

- **Realistic User Simulation**: Sets common browser properties to appear as a regular browser.
- **Random Delays**: Uses slight random delays between actions to appear more human-like.
- **Header Customization**: Uses realistic HTTP headers for all requests.

## How to Use the Enhanced Features

### Basic Usage

The basic usage remains the same:

```javascript
// Create a scraper instance
const scraper = new WebScraper();

// Scrape a website
const result = await scraper.scrapeWebsite("https://example.com");
```

### Using Form Interaction

To interact with forms on a website:

```javascript
const scraper = new WebScraper({
  useHeadless: true, // Required for form interaction
  formInteraction: {
    enabled: true,
    fields: [
      {
        selector: "#search-input",
        value: "search term",
        type: "text",
      },
      {
        selector: "#state-select",
        value: "48", // Washington state
        type: "select",
      },
    ],
    submitButtonSelector: "#search-button",
    waitForSelector: ".results", // Wait for this element to appear after form submission
    waitTime: 3000, // Or wait this many milliseconds
  },
});
```

### Advanced Example: Finding Email Addresses from Sites with Search Forms

This example shows how to search a directory website for contact information:

```javascript
// Create a scraper instance with form interaction enabled
const scraper = new WebScraper({
  useHeadless: true,
  formInteraction: {
    enabled: true,
    fields: [
      {
        selector: "#location",
        value: "New York",
        type: "text",
      },
      {
        selector: "#search-radius",
        value: "50", // 50 miles
        type: "select",
      },
    ],
    submitButtonSelector: 'button[type="submit"]',
    waitTime: 5000,
  },
  // Follow links to detail pages
  followLinks: true,
  maxDepth: 2,
});

// Run the scraper
const result = await scraper.scrapeWebsite(
  "https://example-directory.com/search"
);
```

## How It Works

### Network Response Processing

For AJAX and API responses, the scraper now:

1. Monitors all network requests during page load and interactions
2. Captures responses from endpoints that match common API patterns
3. Uses the generic JSON extractor to find emails and other data regardless of structure
4. Combines this data with the visible page content

### JSON Extraction Logic

The new `extractDataFromJson` function:

1. Recursively traverses any JSON structure (arrays, nested objects, etc.)
2. Identifies fields likely to contain emails, names, phones, etc. by analyzing field names
3. Extracts this data into a structured format for processing
4. Returns both the extracted data and contextual information for better results

## Troubleshooting

If the scraper isn't finding expected data:

1. **Try enabling form interaction**: Some sites only show data after search form submission.
2. **Increase wait time**: Some sites take longer to load dynamic content.
3. **Enable followLinks**: Contact information is often on detail pages.
4. **Examine the browser console**: There might be network errors or CORS issues.

## Limitations

The scraper may still face challenges with:

- Websites using advanced bot protection (reCAPTCHA v3, etc.)
- Single-page applications that require complex session handling
- Websites that perform client-side encryption of responses

For these cases, site-specific customizations may be needed, but the core scraper is now much more capable of handling a wide range of modern websites.
